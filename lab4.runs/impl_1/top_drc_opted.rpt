CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PLCK-23#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	clk_in_hw_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to L5
	clock_generator0/clock_module_TE02770/MMCME2_BASE_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) cannot be placed

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT uart_module0/uart_tx0/tx_index[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    tx_index_reg[0] {FDRE}
    tx_index_reg[1] {FDRE}
    tx_index_reg[2] {FDRE}
    tx_index_reg[3] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
